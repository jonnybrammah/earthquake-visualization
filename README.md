## Project Description

The goal of this project was to visualize recent earthquakes on a Leaflet map, and represent key information about them. A user should be able to open the map and see where recent Earthquakes have been, get a sense of their magnitude and depth, and click for more information. An additional layer was added to show the locations of fault lines. To achieve this, a JavaScript file was written that pulled data of the previous week of earthquakes from the [United States Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) API. The data was then parsed to show the location, magnitude and other relevant information and Leaflet was used to plot this on a map.

### Setting up the Map

### Base Maps

Two standard Leaflet tile layers were used as background maps for this project:

1. Street Map


2. Topographic Map


These were stored as the variable baseMaps and a control was added to be able to switch between these.
